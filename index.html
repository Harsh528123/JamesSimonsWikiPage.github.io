            When you think about the world of finance, you think about business majors and economic majors running Wall Street,
            however, James Simons, a world renowned mathematician has broken into the finance world as one of the most dominating figures. 
            His quantitative hedge fund, Renaissance Technologies has blown the world by showing the big finance moguls that complex math and computer science can make a tremendous change.
            More so, he is one of the pioneers of a quantitative hedge fund and runs his successful firm based on high level computer science and math knowledge. 
            He is a true inspiration for stem majors wanting to break into finance. He is often known as the world's smartest billionaire. More known as Jim Simons, he has a PhD in mathematics from 
            the University of California and a bachelor's degree in mathematics from MIT. He is often known as the "man who cracked Wall Street".

                Renaissance Technology is most prominently known for its ridicously high returns in it's most popular fund, the medallion fund. 
                The fund, unfortunately is exclusive to employees of Renaissance Technologies and has an average annual return of 70.6%. Even 
                with their ridicously high management fees of 30-40%, employees are guaranteed to be millionaires if they hold their money in 
                the fund for even ten years. The fund, founded on the basis of math and computer science, hires mainly STEM majors as it proves 
                to the world that it does not even need a finance major to run the fund. For such a presitgious company, it is a well known fact 
                that many of their employees hold PhDs in many STEM majors such as math and physics. As many other hedge funds, their employees are 
                also held accountable to an FDA. Cracking your way in Renaissance is not easy considering a PhD is the minimum for them to even consider 
                your resume. No matter how appealing a 40% return (after fees) looks it remains one of the hardest companies to get into and can be considered 
                equivalent to Google in terms of prestige. In terms of Renaissance's strategy they use complex algorithims and mathematical models to profit out of market inefficiencies.

            James Simons' strength in math was in geometry and topology of manifolds. His PhD thesis gave a new proof of Berger's classification of the holonomy groups
            of Riemannian manifolds. He also helped discover the Chern-Simons secondary characteristic classes of 3-manifolds. These accomplishments and contributions 
            to the modern physics and math world made him the recipient of the Oswald Veblen Prize in Geometry. What's even more crazy is that he worked with the US 
            National Security Agency to break codes. His strong math background as well as deep level computer science knowledge is what led him to create one of the most leading 
            funds in the world. The success of his firm led him to win Financial Engineer of the Year in 2006.

                In total, Simons has given over $2.7 billion to philanthropic causes. Simons and his second wife, Marilyn Hawrys Simons, co-founded the Simons Foundation in 1994,
                a charitable organization that supports projects related to education and health, in addition to scientific research. The Simons Foundation established the Simons 
                Foundation Autism Research Initiative (SFARI) in 2003 as a scientific initiative within the Simons Foundation's suite of programs. SFARI's mission is to improve the 
                understanding, diagnosis and treatment of autism spectrum disorders. Through the foundation, Simons has been a major benefactor of the University of California, 
                Berkeley. On July 1, 2012, the Simons Foundation pledged $60 million to Berkeley to establish the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing, the world's leading 
                institute for collaborative research in theoretical computer science. The foundation has also made other major gifts to Berkeley, notably to its Mathematical Sciences 
                Research Institute. In memory of his son Paul, whom he had with his first wife, Barbara Simons, he established Avalon Park, a 130-acre (0.53 km2) nature preserve in Stony
                Brook. In 1996, 34-year-old Paul was killed by a car driver while riding a bicycle near the Simons home. Another son Nick Simons, drowned at age 24 while on a trip to Bali
                in Indonesia in 2003. Nick had worked in Nepal. The Simons have become large donors to Nepalese healthcare through the Nick Simons Institute.
