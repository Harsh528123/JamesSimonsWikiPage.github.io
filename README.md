Hi everyone! This is a small little website I made on a public figure I was super interested in. It is like a small wiki page with my own little styling. 
Having learned styling and javascript from the Interactive Web Development Course, I plan on adding a couple more webpages and add a little jazz with CSS and Javascript. 
Since this is just a small fun project I am doing I do not plan on using responsive design for mobile.
